# D2HW Hub for the Night Owl AFC

## A more reliable sensed Hub

Due to issues with the D2F hub and the 5.5mm Ball Bearing and them not always sensing the filament, I have created a hub based on the Box Turtle D2HW and MR63ZZ bearing method which is a lot more reliable. This will always trigger due to the short trigger and long stroke of the D2HW switch with the MR63ZZ bearing being 0.2mm from the bottom of the filament path.
